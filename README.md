# Predicting-Stock-Prices-Keras-
In this project we will learn how to make a stock predictor using keras
We will use LTSMs(long-short-term-memory) tool of python



The code uses the keras  machine learning library to train a support vector regression on a stock price dataset from Google Finance to predict a future price.
